      "Always over promise and under deliever" jokely he didn't realize he said it wrong. However, it's true - you want to always keep in mind to under promise and over deliver. 

      Ebay is a great platform where you can sell anything and make money. They provide all the tools and all you need to make money. It comes down to answering the key question 'what should I sell?'. 

      An that's when reselling comes into play. You can buy inventory or create 'inventory' from items you find around your house.

      The market you choose will shape your approach and potential growth.
