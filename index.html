<p>Making money is a skill. I'm convinced you can go from making $0 a day to $100K if you put in the work. But it comes down to how you approach it. 

Taking the time to learn a this skill and apply it is what matters most. 

Let's start with the basics: 

1. What are you good at? 
2. What market do you want to serve? 
3. What are you interested in most? 

It's not a question of passion it's a question of 'interest'. Taking the time to truly know yourself and what you like or dislike. Could you site behind a computer for 8 hours? Or do you want to be in the outside? </p>
