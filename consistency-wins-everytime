    <h1>Consistency Wins Every Time</h1>
    <p>
      
No matter what you do, if you do it consistently you'll get a win. 

This is something I've always believed in and it continues to remain true. 

'Where preparation meets opportunity' suggests that 'luck' isn't real it's simply the result of being prepared when an opportunity arises. 

Another one, 'always stay ready' is along the similar thought process. 

Ask yourself the following questions 

1. Are you staying consistent on one thing? 
2. What's the most consistent thing you've done lately? 

See many folks can't remember or think of what they've been doing 'consistently'. And sometimes you need to audit your time to find out. 

Put that todo list together every day - make it a habit
- Check this off when done
- Check this other item off when done 
- Check this off when both are done

Think of it as a mountain you are climbing and each item crossed off the list becomes another win on your record.
